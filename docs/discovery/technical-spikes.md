# Discovery Technical Spikes

Use this log to plan and summarize technical spike experiments related to discovery, playback, and storytelling surfaces.

## Proposed Spikes

- **Offline-First Playback:** Prototype caching strategies for long-form audio/video chapters within a PWA context.
- **Adaptive Streaming Controls:** Explore player frameworks that mirror Netflix/YouTube UX patterns.
- **Narration Enhancements:** Test text-to-speech alignment, chapter markers, and dual-language narration akin to Audible.
- **Interactive Reader Modes:** Investigate rendering pipelines for comic and screenplay formats side by side.
