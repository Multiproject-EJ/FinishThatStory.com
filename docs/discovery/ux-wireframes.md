# Discovery UX Wireframes

Sketch wireframes and flow diagrams that translate research insights into interface concepts.

## Priority Flows

1. **Story Discovery Landing:** Outline hero modules, featured rails, and entry points into different media modes.
2. **Immersive Playback:** Show how users transition between audio, video, and comic panels with minimal friction.
3. **Collaborative Creation:** Visualize the pathway from discovering a story to contributing a continuation.

Attach exported images (PNG/SVG) in the `docs/discovery/assets/` folder and embed them here as the designs evolve.
